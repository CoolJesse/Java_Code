Step 1: create Main.java file and module-info.java file
	project_1/Main.java
    module-info.java
	
Step 2: By convention, the source code for the module is in a directory that is the name of the module
	module modules { }
	
Step 3: Write main source code to print message
	package project_1;
	
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Fuck the World!");
        }
    }
	
Step 4: The source code is compiled to the directory mods/project_1 with the following commands:
	$ mkdir -p mods/project_1
	
	 $ javac -d mods/project_1 module-info.java project_1/Main.java
	 
Step 5: Now we run the example with the following command
	$ java --module-path mods -m modules/project_1.Main

--module-path is the module path, its value is one or more directories that contain modules. The -m option specifies the main module, the value after the slash is the class name of the main class in the module
