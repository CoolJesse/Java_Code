/********************** Packages Challenge Read me *************************/

 * Create a suitably named package containing a class called Series with the following static methods:
	- nSum(int n): returns the sum of all numbers from 0 to n.
	- factorial(int n): returns the product of all numbers from 1 to n.
	- fibonacci(int n): returns the nth Fibonacci number. These are defined as f(0)=0, f(1)=1, f(n)=f(n-1)+f(N-2).
	
 * When you have tested your function, delete the Main class and produce a jar file.
 
 * Create a new project and add your Series Library, then test the three methods in the main() method of your new project.
