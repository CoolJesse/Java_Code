// Java Master Class Generics Challenge //

1. Create a generic class to implement a league table for a sport

2. The table should allow teams to be added to the list, and store a list of teams that belong to the league.

3. Your class should have a method to print out the teams in order with the team at the top of the league printed first.

4. Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular instance of the league class. The program should fail to compile if an attempt is made to add an incompatible type.
