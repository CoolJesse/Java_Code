* Modify the playlist challenge so that the Album class uses an inner class, instead of using an Arraylist to hold its tracks. This inner class will be called "Songlist."

* The inner Songlist class will use an ArrayList and will provide a method to add a song. It will also provide a method called "findSong()" which will be used by the containing Album class to add songs to the playlist.

* Neither the Song clas or the Main class should be changed.
